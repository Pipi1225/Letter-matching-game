# Letter-matching-game

**Introduction:**
The Matching Game (Pikachu Puzzle Game) includes a board of multiple cells,
each of which presents a figure. The player finds and matches a pair of cells that
contain the same figure and connect each other in some particular pattern. A legal
match will make the two cells disappear. The game ends when all matching pairs are
found.

This is a course project for University of Science - VNUHCM. In this project, we will develop the Matching Game, but instead of matching
figures, the figures are replaced by characters.

This project is developed by:

When we open the file PIKACHU.exe in the Project folder, we will see there are 4 buttons in this screen. We can use W/ S or Up/Down arrow to select, press Enter to choose:

<br>**NEW GAME:** will ask you to choose which mode (Medium/ Hard). By choosing one of two mode, you will need to enter your name.

After that you will be taken to the game stage.

In medium mode, the stage is like a normal Matching Game, we clear out the stage by matches a pair of cells that contain the same letter.

In hard mode will be a more difficult stage by sliding the neighboring cells (from the game stage) into the newly emptied spaces in right to left direction after a matched, also each match will give you more points.

And if you can't see which cells to choose, you can enter B to use 30 points for a hint.

And you can't use it if your points is negative.

By clear out the stage, you will reveal the background underneath it (Each stage is a random image) and your rank in the leaderboard if your points high enough. Then the game will ask you if you want to continue or not.
