# Letter-matching-game

The Matching Game (Pikachu Puzzle Game) includes a board of multiple cells,
each of which presents a figure. The player finds and matches a pair of cells that
contain the same figure and connect each other in some particular pattern. A legal
match will make the two cells disappear. The game ends when all matching pairs are
found.
In this project, we will develop a Matching Game, but instead of matching
figures, the figures will be changed by characters.
